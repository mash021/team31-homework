Frikadeller (Danish Meatballs)
    Ingredients (4 servings)
    Ground Pork (or a mix of pork and veal) – 1 lb (about 450 g)
    Onion – 1 small, finely chopped or grated
    Egg – 1
    All-Purpose Flour – 2 to 3 tablespoons
    Milk – ⅓ cup (about 80 ml)
    Salt – 1 teaspoon (or to taste)
    Freshly Ground Pepper – ½ teaspoon (or to taste)
    Butter (or oil) – for frying
    (Note: Some Danish recipes call for a bit of club soda or sparkling water instead of milk for a lighter texture. Feel free to experiment!)

    Instructions
    Mix the Meat & Onions

    In a mixing bowl, combine the ground pork (or pork/veal blend) with the finely chopped (or grated) onion.
    Use a fork or your hands to ensure the onions are evenly distributed.
    Add Binding Ingredients

    Stir in the egg, flour, milk, salt, and pepper.
    The mixture should be moist but hold its shape when formed into a small ball. If it’s too wet, add a touch more flour; if it’s too dry, add a bit more milk.
    Rest the Mixture (Optional but Recommended)

    Cover the bowl and let the mixture rest in the refrigerator for 15–30 minutes.
    This step helps the flavors meld and makes the mixture easier to shape.
    Shape the Frikadeller

    With slightly wet or oiled hands, shape the mixture into oval or round patties, about the size of a large tablespoon.
    Traditionally, Frikadeller are somewhat oblong, though shape varies by preference.
    Fry in Butter (or Oil)

    Heat a skillet over medium heat and melt enough butter (or oil) to coat the surface.
    Place the meatballs in the skillet, leaving space between them so they can brown evenly.
    Fry for about 4–5 minutes per side, or until golden brown and fully cooked through (internal temperature of 160°F / 71°C if you’re checking doneness).
    Keep Warm & Serve

    Transfer the cooked Frikadeller to a warm plate lined with paper towels (if needed to drain excess fat).
    Continue frying in batches until all are done.
