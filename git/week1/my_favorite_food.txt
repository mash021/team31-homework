the Ghorme Sabzi : 
    Fresh Herbs (total ~3 cups, finely chopped):
    Parsley (1½ cups)
    Cilantro (1 cup)
    Fenugreek leaves (fresh or a small pinch of dried) – if you can’t find fenugreek, you can omit or use spinach for added greens
    Onion – ½ large onion, finely diced
    Dried Limes (Limoo Amani) – 1 or 2, pierced (optional but very typical in Ghorme Sabzi)
    Kidney Beans – ½ cup cooked (optional nod to tradition)
